<b class="whb">Pitch requires at least 3 people.</b> The dealer shuffles and then deals out six cards to each player, in the pattern of 1, then 2, then 3 cards per deal.

<b class="whb">Now everyone has to bid.</b> How much you bid corresponds to how much confidence you have in the hand you've been dealt. The bidding starts with the person to the left of the dealer, and goes in a circle. You can bid 2, 3, or 4 cards. The bid represents the number of points that you think you will get in this hand. If you aren't confident at all, you may pass, unless you are the last to bid (i.e. the dealer) and everyone else has passed, in which case you have to bid at least 2.

<b class="whb">Once someone has placed a bid, you have to match them, surpass them, or pass on your turn.</b> That is, you cannot bid 2 if 3 has already been bid. The point of bidding is to figure out who is the most confident in his or her hand, because that is the person who is going to get to choose the trump suit.

<b class="whb">What to bid depends on what your hand is, in relation to the points of pitch.</b> The points that you can get in pitch are these: high of trump, low of trump, jack of trump, and game. "High" is the highest trump card played, "low" is the lowest trump card played, "jack" is the jack of trump, and "game" has to do with how many face cards you end up with.

<b class="whb">Which suit becomes trump depends on who bids the highest, because whoever bids the highest gets to throw down first, and the <i>first card</i> that they throw down becomes the trump suit.</b> Therefore, if you have the ace of spades, the 2 of spades, and the jack of spades, you probably want to bid 4, because then you will get to make "spades" the trump suit and you will probably be able to get 4 points.

<b class="whb">Remember, whoever has bid the highest gets to throw down first.</b> Whichever is the first card that they throw becomes the trump suit. Play continues to the left. Everyone throws down one card. The winner of the "hand" is the person who has thrown either the highest card in suit, or the highest trump card. Trump can be played anytime. Trump always beats "in suit."

<b class="whb">If the highest initial bidder (the person who threw the trump at the beginning of the game) has come up with the points that he bid, he gets those points.</b> If not, he gets negative those points. Meanwhile, anyone else who scores points gets them free of charge (i.e., if the bidder bid 3, and he got high low and game, he gets 3 points. The person who got jack gets 1 point. If the bidder bid 3, and got high and low, he gets negative three points. Whoever got jack gets a point, whoever got game gets a point.)
