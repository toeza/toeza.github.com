<b class="whb">Pick your signal.</b> Only you and your partner should know what this is. You do your signal to your partner when you have four of a number (or face card). If your partner says "signal" when you do your signal (without anybody saying "cut"), than you win the game. If someone says "cut" when you weren't doing your signal, then they are out.

<b class="whb">Deal out the cards.</b> Each player gets four. You <i>can</i> look at your cards. Do not use the jokers. Put the extra cards into groups of four, do not look at these groups.

<b class="whb">Know the point of the game.</b> During the game, you can only have four cards. During each round, the dealer will flip up one group of four cards. You can take up to four cards, but you have to dispose of as many cards that you took, so that you remain with four cards throughout the game.

<b class="whb">Know how to win.</b> You win when you have four of a number (or face card) and your partner has said signal without anyone saying "cut", than your team has won (or if it's the other way around). If your partner has four and you say signal successfully, then your team has won.
