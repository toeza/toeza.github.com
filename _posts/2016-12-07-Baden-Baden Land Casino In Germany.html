<p><p>When one thinks of a land casino in Europe, the name that first comes to mind is the Monte Carlo Casino. Then one would look at Paris, London, the Riviera and some of the other cities in Europe. Most people would be unaware of Baden-Baden Casino in Baden-Baden, a town more famous for its spa and thermal waters. The German word baden translates as to bathe or baths. Yet Baden-Baden Casino is not only one of the foremost land casinos in Europe, but also in the world. It was included by Forbes in the top ten world casinos.</p>
<p>In the late 18th century Baden-Baden was regularly visited by the Prussian royal family and other members of the European aristocracy. They decided to legalize gambling in Baden-Baden in 1801. By 1809 organized gambling was established in the town??s hotels and dedicated gambling halls. In 1824 the Kurhaus spa was created by the renowned architect Friedrich Weinbrenner and the Casino Baden-Baden was first established there. In 1838, the casino was taken over by French casino magnate Jacques Benazet, who introduced roulette tables. After his death in 1848, his son Edouard took over the running of the casino. Over 150 years ago he had the vision to realize that a property like Baden-Baden Casino could not survive on gambling alone. He brought other forms of entertainment in the form of famous actors and musicians. In 1855 new gambling halls designed and decorated by only the best were added. Edouard Benazet ensured that Baden-Baden was among the foremost casinos of the time in Europe. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, following Germany??s unification under the Prussian royal family a law was passed ordering the closure of all of German casinos in 1872. This remained in force until 1933, when Baden-Baden Casino opened for the second time. It carried through much of the Second World War till 1944, when it had to shut down. Baden-Baden Casino opened for the third time on April 1, 1950 and has remained open since then. The expansion in 1995 made it the biggest casino in Europe. </p>
<p>Today Baden-Baden Casino is owned by Baden-W??rttembergischen Spielbanken GmbH & Co. It offers over 130 slot machines, both electromechanical slots and video slots. The table games include Roulette, Baccarat, Blackjack and Texas Hold??em Poker. In 2003 the casino introduced the novel Eurolette tables for roulette. One unusual aspect about Baden-Baden Casino is that it has different opening hours and entry fees for different games. Slots can be played from noon onwards, with the entrance fee being as low as ?1. Table games can be played after 2 PM with the entrance fee being ?5. The casino is also popular for poker tournaments. A variety of tournaments with different structures and buy-ins are always running. Yet places need to be booked in advance. </p>
<p>The modern Kurhaus is the town??s leading cultural establishment, hosting musical performances, readings and dance events. The Sommergarten restaurant is known for its Mediterranean and international cuisine. And wandering through lavishly designed Kurhaus buildings and gardens is an experience to remember. Unlike the modern casinos of Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Macau, Baden-Baden Casino does not have residential accommodation, but that is never a problem. The town has hotels to suit all tastes and budgets. Several renowned persons have visited Baden-Baden Casino. Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler while compulsively gambling there. Marlene Dietrich said that the casino was the most beautiful in the world. The most exciting piece of Badem-Baden Casino trivia is that at one time real silver and gold chips were used on the roulette tables. </p></p>
