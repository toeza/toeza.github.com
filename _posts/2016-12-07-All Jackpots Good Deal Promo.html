<p><p>All Jackpots online casino has launched a wagering contest promotion in video poker and table games that is called Good Deal. The leaders in this exciting scoreboard competition will share a prize pool of 5,000 credits. The write up to the promotion reads &quot;Got an ace up your sleeve? Get a good deal and turn your cards into winnings!&quot;</p>
<p>The Good Deal promotion runs between 12:01 AM on Tuesday November 16 and 11:59 PM on Monday November 22. It is structured in the same manner as the usual scoreboard competitions at All Jackpots online casino. In order to join in the promotion players have to deposit and wager 50 credits on any eligible video poker or table game to start earning points. The eligible games include all forms of video poker, power poker, table poker, red dog, casino war and blackjack. Live blackjack tournaments, baccarat, craps, roulette and sic bo are, however, excluded. Players will earn 1 point for every 50 credits wagered during the promotion period. They will also earn 1 point for every 50 credits won or lost by the end of each day. Wins and losses are the positive or negative difference between the amount wagered and amount paid out. The Good Deal promotion scoreboard will be updated every 30 minutes to reflect points earned through wagering. For points earned through wins and losses, the scoreboard will be updated once per day throughout the promotion period. Players are advised to frequently check out the scoreboard and adjust their level of wagering as required. At the end of the promotion period, the top 100 players on the scoreboard will share 5,000 credits in prizes. The top three players will win 1,000 credits, 500 credits and 250 credits respectively. The credits will be awarded in the currency of wagering of the player. All Jackpots online casino allows wagering in a number of currencies such as American dollar, Canadian dollar, euro and British pound. The winners will receive their credits within 24 hours of the closing of the promotion.<br>
These credits will be treated as bonuses and must be played through thirty times before making a withdrawal. VIP players must play through their bonuses fifteen times. Bonus credits not played within 30 days of being awarded will be deemed to have expired and will be removed. </p>
<p>There are more than 15 variants of video poker on offer at All Jackpots online casino. The power poker games offer from 4 hands to 100 hands being played simultaneously. There are more than 40 variants of blackjack available. Many of them follow the rules of Las Vegas, Atlantic City or European land casinos. However, there are exclusive online blackjack games like Double Exposure and High Streak. All Jackpots online casino is powered by software from Microgaming and is licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission.<br />
