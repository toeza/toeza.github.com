<p><p>All Slots online casino is offering a short duration leader board promotion. It started on November 22 and will run till the end of the month. Based on video poker and table games this promotion is appropriately called Head of the Table Playoff.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the promotion players have to deposit and wager at least 50 credits during the promotion period. All Slots online casino offers a large variety of games to choose from for the wagering. The games include all forms of video poker, power poker, table poker, red dog, casino war and blackjack. However live blackjack tournaments, baccarat, craps, roulette and sic bo are excluded. Players earn points while they are wagering, which will help them to move up the Head of the Table Playoff leader board. Players will earn 1 point for each 50 credits wagered during the promotion period. 1 point will also be earned for 50 credits won per day and 1 point for 50 credits lost per day. Wins and losses are the positive or negative differences between the amount wagered and amount paid out. For points earned through wagering the leader board will be updated every 30 minutes. For the points earned through wins and losses the leader board will be updated once a day.</p>
<p>At the end of the promotion period the players that are heading the leader board will share the prize pool. The prize pool consists of 10,000 casino credits and runs deep. The player in the first place will win 1,000 casino credits. The next four players will win 500, 250, 125 and 75 casino credits respectively. Players in the 6th to 10th places will win 50 casino credits; players in the 11th to 15th places will win 45 casino credits; players in the 16th to 25th places will win 40 casino credits; players in the 26th to 45th places will win 35 casino credits; players in the 46th to 65th places will win 30 casino credits and players in the 66th to 100th places will win 25 casino credits. The casino credits won in the Head of the Table Playoff promotion will be treated as bonuses and winners will have to meet the wagering requirements. Normal players will have to play through the prizes 30 times and VIP players will have to play through the prizes 15 times. The wagering requirements will have to be met within 30 days of being awarded the prizes.
