<p><p>All Slots online casino had been replaying its old popular promotions for some time. So it is welcome news that it has just launched a brand new promotion featuring some of its best video poker and casino poker games. The promotion is called Good Deal and the invitation reads, &quot;Got an ace up your sleeve? Get a good deal and turn your cards into winnings!&quot;</p>
<p>The Good Deal promotion at All Slots online casino is structured similarly as many of its earlier promotions. In order to sign up for the promotion players have to deposit and wager 50 credits on any eligible video poker or table game. Then players start earning points as they play. They will earn 1 point for every 50 credits wagered over the promotion period. And they will earn 1 point for every 50 credits won or lost by the end of each day. Wins and losses are the positive or negative difference between the amount wagered and amount paid out.</p>
<p>As they wager their position will rise or fall on the leader board. At the end of the promotion the top players on the leader board will share the prize pool. The scoreboard will be updated every 30 minutes to reflect points earned through wagering. For points earned through wins and losses, the scoreboard will be updated once per day throughout the promotion. The Good Deal promotion starts at 12:01 a.m. GMT on Wednesday, July 21 and ends at 11:59 p.m. GMT on Tuesday, July 27.</p>
<p>The total prize pool set aside for this promotion is 5,000 credits. Players will get paid the number of credits they have won in the currency in which they have chosen to wager. The players in the first five places will win 1,000 credits, 500 credits, 250 credits, 125 credits and 75 credits respectively. Thereafter several other players will win lower amounts. In all 100 players will share the prize pool. All variants of video poker and power poker games are eligible. Players can also wager on table poker, red dog, casino war and blackjack games. However, live blackjack tournaments, baccarat, craps, roulette and sic bo are excluded. </p>
<p>The prizes will be credited and the winners will be notified within 24 hours of the closing of the promotion. The prizes are to be treated as bonuses and must be played through thirty times before making a withdrawal. VIP players can play through their bonuses fifteen times. Bonus credits not played within 30 days of being awarded will be deemed to have expired and will be removed from the players' accounts.</p>
<p>All Slots online casino is powered by software from Microgaming and is licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission. It is a leading brand of the Jackpot Factory group of online casinos.<br />
