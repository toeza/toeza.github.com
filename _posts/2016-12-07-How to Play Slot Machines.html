These machines can bombard your senses with lights, sounds, or vibrations, all of which are designed to entice you to play either in a casino or online. Because of their ability to draw attention, slot machines tend to be the most popular type of game at a casino. Anxious to join in on the fun? Here's how.</p>

<b class="whb">Join any "slot clubs" or "player perks" your casino offers.</b> These programs will reward you based on how much you play and can give you the opportunity to cash in for additional benefits. Compare the incentives of different casinos or sites, and choose the casino based on the benefits or freebies that are the best for you.

<ul>
<li>As a member, you may get additional offers in mail or online. During casinos' off-seasons, it's common for them to try to lure you in with free play, free food, or a free hotel stay (or all three). So if you're going to spend your money anyway, you might as well sign up. Always check the player desk daily to learn about daily promotions and special offers; many of them are not advertised online.</li>
<li>If this is your first time, walk around and get to know the facility, especially if you are staying as a hotel guest. Generally, casinos are layed out with the action in the middle and the services around the perimeter. Notice where the rest rooms and emergency exits are located. Look at the floor and you will see the ugliest carpeting you have ever seen; that is there on purpose to keep you looking up, not down. But the floor will also show you where the main walkways are, should you become lost. Also notice the overhead signs that indicate different areas and how to get back to where you were.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Know what you're looking at.</b> Though there are different types of machines all of varying, payouts, popularity, and method, how they work is generally all the same. There's just a few things you should know how to work:

<ul>
<li>You can pay with a previous payout ticket, your member card, or cash. Often (if not always), the previous payout ticket will go in the same slot the cash can be inserted. Most machines take $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 dollar bills, though some also take $1, too. These areas will be lit up and unmissable. If you see the Bill Acceptor not lit, or flashing blue, it is in need of service or what is called a Bill Drop [emptying out the accepted cash and making it ready to accept new money]. Press the HELP or SERVICE button to summon an attendant.</li>
<li>Most machines no longer spit out coins. If you're looking for a coin tray, you may be looking for a while. New machines use the TITO system [ticket in, ticket out]. Some casinos have reverted back to coin usage in the high limit areas, as it takes less time to play coins that it does to insert paper. But for machines of $500 denomination and higher, you will need a ticket to play.</li>
<li>For certain variations of games, the methodology is spelled out on the glass above the screen. It'll tell you what type of game it is, what each spin pays out, and details on the jackpot. If it's there, read it before you sit down. Some machines will be blatantly better than others. Machines tend to be grouped by denomination, style and brand name. Video slots have a HELP or INFO button that will walk you through the various payouts, play lines, bonus games and special features.</li>
<li>Each machine has a light on top of it called a 'candle'. The candle contains a color indicating its denomination, and also serves to notify the slot attendant if service is needed. The candle flashes in specific patterns for service needed, entry made into the machine, jackpot, door not secure, and other functions.</li>
<li>Locate the "Cash Out" button. This is how you'll finally be freed from your semi-conscious state and released into the world of windows, clocks, and not-for-free soda. Press it and it'll tabulate your winnings and issue a ticket, which you can then take to the cashier or to the payout redemption machine -- if you win, of course. Keep in mind that tickets are bearer instruments; whoever holds it can redeem it. So guard it as you would cash. If you find one on the floor or other location, do NOT attempt to redeem it; turn it in to Security or other official. All tickets are numbered and time-stamped, and attempting to cash out one that isnt yours can get you in trouble, up to and including being ejected and barred from the location!</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Decide the amount that you're comfortable betting each pull.</b> With slot machines, you can bet a surprisingly high amount of money in no time. In fact, they can move faster than some table games. There are machines where you'll get by betting 50 cents and other machines that, in order to really be playing, you'll need to bet $5. Find an amount that doesn't make your stomach churn?

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, if more money is needed to hit the jackpots, you should bet it (why play if you can't win?). So if you're not looking to dip into your grandmother's inheritance, the penny, nickel, or quarter slots may be more to your liking. And you'll get more playing time out of your dollar in the long run!</li>
<li>Most casinos lay out these machines in sections. You'll see giant lit-up signs displaying "5??" or "25??" or "1??." If the casino is a maze (as some seem to intentionally be), just grab a waitress or attendant to be pointed in the right direction. High limit slots, usually $5 and higher, are located in separate rooms or 'salons', with their own attendants and cashiers.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Don't buy into casino mapping.</b> Sure, casinos employ a certain level of strategy in placing their slots, but each one varies and it's not something so simple as to be understood with a quick glance or paragraph. What's more, with technology nowadays, they can change a machine's payout at the click of the button. So before you go asking that cute hostess where you should play, think again.

<ul>
<li>While we're at it, the concept of a "hot" machine also doesn't pan out logically. Realistically speaking, a slot machine is a like a pair of dice. You may feel like after you roll four sixes in a row you're probably not going to get another six, but in all likelihood, the six is just as likely to come up again as every other number. With each roll, the dice starts back over. And the slot machine is the same. It's only over the course of an absolutely Titanic-sized number of turns that the casinos are getting their payout numbers.<sup id="_ref-how_1-0" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference how">[1]</sup> Unless you plan on making a career out of risking your money, there's no point in letting it factor into your decisions.</li>

<b class="whb">Master the multiplier machine.</b> This is the type where if you play a coin, you get a certain amount of money. If you play two coins, you get a much bigger amount of money. And if you play three coins, well, you'd be practically robbing the bank if you won.

<ul>
<li>Betting more doesn't increase your chances of winning, so it's fine not to bet max on this type of game. This kind is fairly straightforward in that if you bet a small amount, you'll win a small amount; bet a large amount, you'll win a large amount -- but it doesn't effect the <i>number of times you win</i>.</li>
<li>Look for machines that don't have much of a discrepancy between the coins if you're looking to save your money. If one coin gets you 2000 on the jackpot, and 2 coins gets you 5000, but three coins gets you 45000, you may want to walk away. Imagine what would happen if you bet one coin and hit it big! You'd be sulking all the way to the buffet.</li>

<b class="whb">Bet a bunch on buy-a-pays.</b> Not only is that alliteration, but it's true. If you're on a buy-a-pay, always bet the max. One coin may buy you the center line, two coins will buy you a diagonal, and three coins gets you the whole 9 yards. This also works with symbols. Again, imagine yourself betting one coin and seeing 7-7-7 come up in a diagonal! If you do choose this machine, it's best to go big or go home.

<ul>
<li>In other words, this machine doesn't increase the amount you win if were to bet more, it just increases the amount of winning combinations or places you have access to. You're literally buying what will pay you. And no, if the machine hits but you didn't pay for it, the machine <i>still</i> counts that as a payout -- it won't make up for it in its 93% payback (or whatever it may be).</li>
<li>Buy-a-pay slots are recognizable by the layout of their pay tables. Notice, for example, that a Double Diamond slot has the same symbols shown for one coin or two coin play. All symbols are active regardless of coins played. But look at Bally's Flaming 7s machine, and you will see the bars listed for one coin and the 7s listed for two coins. For the sevens to be active, you must play both coins per play. If the 7s come up with only 1 coin in, you do not win. As we have mentioned before, learn so you can earn!
<ul>
<li>Some video machines work like this, but those get their separate section.</li>

<b class="whb">Plug into the progressive slots.</b> If you see a whole bunch of people at a row of machines with a giant display board above them that's turning into quite the spectacle, that's a community progressive game. These types of slots have a jackpot total that grows each time the machines are played. All their machines are linked up to each other's and the first person to hit the jackpot gets a percentage of all the play, not just their own.<sup id="_ref-how_1-1" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference how">[1]</sup>
<ul>
<li>Just like on the buy-a-pays, you wanna bet the max on this type of game, too. If you don't bet the max, you won't be winning the jackpot. You can get smaller cash prizes, but the jackpot won't have your name on it. So if you do spend your time at this machine -- which, in its defense, can have ridiculously large jackpots -- be ready to turn out your pockets.</li>

<b class="whb">Venture into the video games.</b> These are otherwise referred to as "multi-line" games and they work similarly to buy-a-pays. You get to choose how many lines you'd like to buy and how many credits you'd like to spend on each line. At a penny slot, you could spend 1?? on the center line and take a spin. It probably won't pay you anything, but you could do it. Some machines have up to 500 lines that you can bet on, and you can usually bet somewhere between a penny and a dollar per line (depending).

<ul>
<li>Consider your position. If you are playing a video slot with 100 paylines at $1 per line, your minimum bet is $100 per play. You are now playing a high-limit bet on a $1 slot. For greater payback percentage, increased ratings as a player and more personalized attention, you may wish to move over to the high-limit machines.</li>
<li>You do not need to bet max on this game, but you should bet <i>all the lines</i>. That way, not a turn will go by where you see a winner but don't get it reflected in your winnings (because you didn't bet the line). The machine doesn't care which lines you're betting and won't adjust its payout rates accordingly, so bet 'em all to catch 'em all.</li>
<li>Video games are far and away the most popular slot as of late. That's because they offer bonus rounds, scatter pays and special events fairly regularly. In addition to the fun and varied animation, it gives you the sense that you're actually playing a <i>game</i> and may have a chance at winning.
<ul>
<li>Okay, so video poker may be more popular, but that's another beast entirely. If you'd like to take a stab at this world, wikiHow has resources for that, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Winning combinations will criss-cross, use diagonals, Ms, Ws, squigglies, curly-cues, and other directions, depending on the game. Even if you think you're not winning, you might be and when you think you're winning, you may not be. Just take in the pretty pictures and try to keep your head above water. And then saddle up for a bonus round and put those free spins to work.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Settle on a game.</b> Now that you know the different variations of play, the casino is your oyster. Find a machine that's open and settle down for what will hopefully be a long spell. Insert your player's card (even if you're not using it to access cash -- you'll get points this way) and then either insert cash or a previous payout ticket. Then it's all shiny lights and buzzes from there!

<ul>
<li>Follow the prompts on the screen or read the directions above it. If you get confused or the machine doesn't seem to be working, call an attendant (there's a button on the dash that will do this for you -- the machine will light up, notifying them) to help you.</li>
<li>When you're ready to leave, hit the "Cash Out" button. This will print you a receipt that you can then take to a Casino ATM or to the cashier's box. Once obtained, remove your player's card and hit the patterned carpeting. What time is it, anyway?</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Mind your manners.</b> Though casinos are hot spots for hedonism, that doesn't mean they're not subject to maintaining a certain amount of class. In general, the etiquette rules of any given casino are fairly logical:

<ul>
<li>If you see a jacket on a chair or a chair is pushed up against a machine, it's taken. Don't use it. You'll just end up in the middle of a confrontation when the person gets back from the bathroom.</li>
<li>Don't play more than one or two machines at a time. And if the casino is even remotely crowded, only play the one. Don't ruin someone else's good time with your insatiable appetite for handle-pulling.</li>
<li>If you see someone get a jackpot that should've been yours, don't fuss: There's no such thing. Each computer is going through thousands of combinations every minute and the likelihood that you would've pressed the button at that exact one-hundredth of a second are incredibly minute. Worse than the odds of you walking away with a padded wallet!<sup id="_ref-how_1-2" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference how">[1]</sup>

<b class="whb">Know your limits.</b> Alright, it's time for the disclaimer: You must know your limits and you must stop playing when you reach them. Before you begin gambling, determine a dollar amount you can afford to lose as well as an amount you will walk away with should you win. Both are equally important, as they can help you know when to stop gambling.

<b class="whb">Walk into the casino with only the money you will be playing with.</b> Leave credit or debit cards and access to additional funds at home or in your hotel room safe, where you won't be tempted to overspend.

<ul>
<li>If at all possible, section out your money for the night. Tell yourself you'll only spend a certain amount every half hour. If you're up at the end of that 30 minutes, you get to bank what you profited (and keep going with the original amount!). And if you run out of money, you wait until the next half hour mark rolls around and proceed again. The night will last much, much longer.<sup id="_ref-how_1-3" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference how">[1]</sup>

<b class="whb">Choose the lowest denomination possible for the slot machine you want to play.</b> This will allow you to play the slot machine for longer periods of time and can maximize your gaming experience. If you're going with a budget in mind, buy-a-pays and progressive machines aren't your best bet, literally. Stick to multi-line games or multiplier machines.

<b class="whb">Select slot machines with the highest payback percentages.</b> This number indicates how frequently the machines pay out, and the higher the percentage the more likely your chances of winning. These amounts should be clearly displayed on the machines and will range anywhere from 80% to 98% -- the higher the denomination of the machine (1?? for example), the higher the payout.

<ul>
<li>Be aware that the payout numbers may apply to a bank of machines as opposed to individual units (like in progressive games), and not all machines in that row will pay out the same. You may need to watch other players gamble for a bit to determine which slots are better options.</li>
<li>For purposes of clarity, that 98% payout means that you'll win 98?? for every dollar you spend. That is, if you were to spend the greater part of this decade there.
<ul>
<li>Machines in Vegas are purported to payout more.<sup id="_ref-how_1-4" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference how">[1]</sup> But remember, this is over the long-term. Machines have the same number of combinations each time you take a turn. If you win or don't win on one spin, you have the same chances of winning or not winning next time.</li>

<b class="whb">Pocket any winnings you earn.</b> Never play with money you've won, because it goes against your beginning strategy of only playing what you predetermined you would spend while gambling. And even though instant gratification is a wonderful thing, you'll feel a lot better walking home with money in your pocket than you would if you simply got to spend an extra 20 minutes at the casino.

<ul>
<li>When you get home, put your winnings into a jar. The next time you go to the casino, take your bankroll out of that. If there's nothing in the jar after a few times, either cut down what you're spending or cut down on the number of times you go in any given period of time. Or wait until the casino sends you free play in the mail!</li>
