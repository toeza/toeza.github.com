Need for Speed: No Limits Will Be a Mobile Exclusive Racer from EA

								<p>I don&#8217;t know much (or anything, really) about rally racing, but I know one thing rally racers don&#8217;t: loose lips sink ships. It&#8217;s a lesson that racing star Ken Block has somehow lived without until today, revealing a new car for his upcoming Gymkhana?7 video?on his Facebook page?featuring a sponsorship from a yet-to-be announced Need for Speed game, Need for Speed: No Limits.</p>
<p>IGN reached out to EA for comment, who confirmed that Need for Speed: No Limits would be a mobile-exclusive entry for the series.?While we&#8217;ve had some great mobile Need for Speed games in the past (Hot Pursuit, Most Wanted),?we&#8217;ve never had an exclusive before. It should be interesting to see how that changes the approach.</p>
<p>Free-to-play seems like a safe bet, but we won&#8217;t go jumping to conclusions until we learn more. EA are promising more details &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
