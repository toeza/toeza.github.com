Sumico Is Coming to iOS This Wednesday

								<p>2014 has been a pretty cool year for math games. Take Sumico, for instance. This math puzzler launched on Android earlier this summer and had no trouble wooing us with its algebraic charms.</p>
<p>Now the developers are adding one more (see what I did there?) platform to their offerings: as of?Wednesday, November 12th, the game will be available on iOS worldwide.</p>

<p>What can players expect from Sumico? How about a game that challenges you to reach a sum using as many different numbers and operations as you can connect with a single line on a hexagonal board.</p>
<p>That sounded too clinical. Let&#8217;s try again. MATH FUN IS GOOD FUN.</p>
<p>There, that should do it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to grab this one for free (with an option in-app purchase to remove the ads) when it arrives on the App Store later this week. Read our Sumico review to find out why you should.</p>
