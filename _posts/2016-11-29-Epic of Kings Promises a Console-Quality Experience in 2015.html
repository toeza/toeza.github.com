Epic of Kings Promises a Console-Quality Experience in 2015

								<p>There have been lots of?games to promise console-quality experiences on mobile, but when it came time to put their money where their mouth is, the results are often less then spectacular.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not say it hasn&#8217;t been done &#8211; I&#8217;m just saying it&#8217;s a bit of a crapshoot. For every Horn or Skylanders?out there, there are a dozen games that shoot for the moon and end up with disastrous results.</p>
<p>Which will Epic of Kings be? I have no idea, but based on the trailer it sure looks pretty.</p>

<p>The gameplay looks like it takes its cues from Infinity Blade, and we&#8217;ve seen more than a few games in the past that succeeded with that formula. And it&#8217;s also from Dead Mage, the developers behind the tremendously good Shadow Blade, so there&#8217;s reason to hope.</p>
<p>Expect Epic of Kings on Android and iOS in early 2015.</p>
