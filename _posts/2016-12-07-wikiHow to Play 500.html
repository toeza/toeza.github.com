<b class="whb">Deal the cards - Give 3 cards to the person sitting to the right of the dealer and then 3 cards to the other people until you're back to the dealer.</b> Put 3 cards in the middle of the table.

<b class="whb">Start by bidding.</b> This is slightly complicated. In 500 there are 4 suits of cards. The hearts are worth the most followed by diamonds then clubs and finally spades. The person to the right of the dealer begins. An example of a bid is '7 spades' or '7 diamonds'. This means that the player thinks he or she can win 7 tricks (during the play whoever puts down the highest card wins the 'trick'). If the player does not have good enough cards then they say pass [They can also *indicate* Indicating is saying you have an okay hand in a certain suit and could potentially help out your parter]. The next player has his or her bid. This player must bid higher than the first person [Or pass, no one can indicate, after the first *real* bid is placed. For example if the 1st player bid '7 diamonds' the 2nd player must bid '7 hearts' or 8 anything. And so it continues around the table[If no one wants to bid at all, the cards are redealt]. They take the pot (the 5 cards in the middle of the table). (Read tips)

<b class="whb">The person who has the pot must then put 5 cards back out again.</b> They can be the same cards or they might not be.

<ul>
<li>The person who has just had the pot throws out a starting card. Usually this is an Ace(A) of an off suit (the suits which are not trump) or the joker or a very low card.</li>
<li>The person to the right of that plays next. He or she must throw out a card of the same suit. If the player does not have one of the same suit he or she can throw out another suit [but this suit has no value what-so-ever, you must follow suit to have a chance @ the trick].<br>
&lt;br.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Play continues like this until all the cards are gone.</b> Count up how many tricks the person who won the bid (the person who was holding the pot) and his or hers partner has together. If there is equal or greater over the amount that they bid (example: They bid 7 diamonds and they have 8 tricks) then they win the amount of points for the trick bid( eg: 7 diamonds). If they didn't win the amount of tricks they lose that amount. (Read Tips)
