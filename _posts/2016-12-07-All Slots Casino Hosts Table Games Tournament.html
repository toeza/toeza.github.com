<p><p>All Slots online casino is hosting an online leader board tournament in table games and video poker. This tournament has been given the name Head of the Table Playoff. The tournament has commenced on October 19 and will run till October 26. In order to participate in this tournament players at All Slots online casino have to deposit and wager at least 50 credits. The games on which the wagering has to be done include all variants of video poker and power poker offered at the casino and also casino poker games, red dog, casino war and variants of blackjack. Wagering on table games like baccarat, craps, roulette and sic bo will not count. Also wagering on live blackjack tournaments will not count.</p>
<p>As players wager on the eligible games they will earn points which will enable them to rise up the leader board. Players will get one point for every 50 credits wagered during the promotion period. They will also get one point for every 50 credits won during the day and one point for every 50 credits lost during the day. Wins and losses are defined as the positive and negative differences between the amount wagered and the amount paid out. The leader board will be updated every 30 minutes for the points earned through the wagering. The points earned through wins and losses will be updated once a day. However, since players have a fair idea of how much they have won or lost they can factor in those many points in their own calculations. At the end of the promotion period the designated number of players heading the leader board will share the prize pool of 10,000 credits. The player on top of the leader board will win the top prize of 1,000 credits. In the event of a tie based on the number of points, the player with the higher wagering will be placed higher on the leader board. The accounts of the winners will be credited within 24 hours of the completion of the online tournament. The prizes will be treated as bonuses and will have a wagering requirement of 15 times. This requirement has to be met within 30 days of the account being credited. If the wagering requirement is not met within 30 days the prize will deemed to have expired and will be withdrawn.</p>
