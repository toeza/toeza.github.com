<b class="whb">Next, bet them a fair amount of money between $2 and $10.</b> Say that they have to peel and eat three bananas in 60 seconds. The Guinness World Record is 1 1/2 bananas in 1 min. (or something like that) so three bananas is impossible. Even add an extra 30 sec. if wanted. Do this many times, $10 each, and the money will start rolling in!

<b class="whb">Bet an unliked family member that they can't steal a family member/friend's Nintendo DS game without getting caught.</b> And say that they have to do it in a large room full of people. This will make it more difficult, so you might win this.

<b class="whb">Bet a friend that they can't create a folder called "con".</b> It works also with other names: prn, aux, nul... Windows forbids you to create them, because their names have a particular meaning. You will SURELY win this bet, <i>if the friend isn't an expert of computers.</i>

<b class="whb">Bet him that you can do it.</b> Go in Start - Execute and type "cmd". You should see a black window. Type "cd desktop", then "mkdir con\" (Note: to type \ you must use the button near to 1, not shift+7.) At the end, close the Commands Prompt. On the desktop, you should see the "con" folder.
