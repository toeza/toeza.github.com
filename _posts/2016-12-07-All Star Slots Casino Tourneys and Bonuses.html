<p><p>All Star Slots online casino has got some exciting promotions lined up for the beginning of February. This is apart from the regular committed bonuses it offers under the scheme Continual Bonuses every month. The Continual Bonuses offer an unlimited number of deposit bonus coupons for wagering on online slots and other games.</p>
<p>The tournament will be held from Friday February 4 to Monday February 7. Though it has been designated as a tournament it is in effect a wagering contest. There are separate contests in different game categories. Within each category the top three wagerers share the prize pool. The first placed player will win a prize of $100, the second placed player will win $75 and the third placed player will win $50. The three games categories are online slots, video poker and blackjack.</p>
<p>All Star Slots online casino is offering attractive bonuses to players to enable them to wager wholeheartedly in the tournament. The slots players will get a bonus of $250 against a deposit of $100. The blackjack and video poker players will get a bonus of $75 against a deposit of $100. There is a reason for the lower blackjack and video poker bonuses. Since players are more likely to win while wagering on blackjack and video poker they will need less assistance from All Star Slots online casino.</p>
<p>The bonus promotion will start on Tuesday February 8 and will run till Thursday February 10. The invitation to the bonus reads &quot;Hey honey! We know you love to shop! Skip the masses at the malls and have your 'Shopping Spree' at our place. Save even more with our special coupons that keep you shopping longer!&quot; There are three coupons on offer during the promotion period. Each coupon offers a bonus that is 75% of the deposit made. The minimum deposit needs to be $100 and the maximum bonus can be $1,000.</p>
<p>Players who redeem these bonus coupons will have to meet wagering requirements. The deposit and bonus must be wagered 25 times before a withdrawal is permitted. However, wagers on Blackjack, Video Pokers and Multihand Video Poker will count as 0.6. This means that a $1 wager on blackjack will only reduce the wagering requirements by only $0.60. Wagers on Roulette, Bingo, Baccarat, Craps, Poker and Sic Bo will not count towards this requirement.</p>
<p>All Star Slots online casino is a brand of the Club World group and is licensed in the gaming jurisdiction of Curacao. It is powered by software from Realtime Gaming. There are two slots games titled Shopping Spree on offer at All Star Slots. The earlier one has a progressive jackpot that is currently around a million dollars. The second one was released late in 2009. It has slicker graphics, but the progressive jackpot is much lower.<br />
