<p><p>If you have been reading up on Baccarat rules, strategy, history, and even odds you will know there is not a lot to the game.  In fact there is hardly any strategy that you can design to win 100 percent of the time or even as much as 80 percent.  The house will always have the edge in any gambling game, and Baccarat is no different in that respect.  There are however, some things you can keep in mind for a Baccarat scheme that could potentially help you win more times than not. </p>
<p>There are three house edges that you need to be concerned with in this game.  The house edge for the banker is 1.06 percent, 1.24 percent for the player, and 14.36 percent for a tie.  Right here you can see that betting on the banker every time is going to give you the upper hand over the other two bets.  It doesn't mean you will win every time of course.  The banker simply wins about three to four times more than the player. </p>
<p>In Baccarat you can be a player and still bet on the banker.  When you bet on the banker the casino will take a 5 percent tax on your winnings.  It is their way to increase their monetary spending.  It started that they charged for the banker winnings because the banker was not always someone at the casino.  The banker can be a player in which the banking position rotates after every round. </p>
<p>In this article we are going to discuss the Martingale theory of strategy.  This theory is that you should increase your bet every time you lose.  For example if you wagered $5 on the first round and lost, then the next wager should be $10.  In other words you keep doubling the bet as you lose.  On the opposite side of that the system tells you to bet less when you are in a winning streak.  A lot of individuals get suckered into this system.  They think that it makes sense, and to a certain degree it does, but that is a false assumption theory.  The point is if you bet more when you lose the next time you win you make up everything you have lost.  By betting less when you are winning you save your money and don't throw it away in case you lose the next round.</p>
<p>Instead what you need to do is establish how many rounds of the game you will be playing.  Then you divide your bankroll by the number of rounds.  This is the amount you can bet per hand.  You don't even have to bet that much depending on your bankroll.  Just make sure you are at least able to handle the table minimum.  You will never increase your bet or decrease it.  Always bet the same.  If after five to ten rounds depending on how many you are playing you have lost then move on to a new table or change your betting strategy. <br>
