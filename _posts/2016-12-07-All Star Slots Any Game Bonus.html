<p><p>February is a short month and this is what All Star Slots online casino has to say about it. &quot;Hmmm??.. didn't February just start? So, where has it gone? Once again another month has just flown on by with some of the last traces of winter's winds! Well, that's okay ?C we'll just look forward to the next month that's now upon us which will be jam packed with fun, fun, fun!&quot; And true to its word All Star Slots online casino has announced three exciting bonuses for March.</p>
<p>The first bonus is titled &quot;Pick the game you like&quot; and will be available from Tuesday March 1 to Thursday March 3. During this period players can redeem the bonus coupon thrice. The coupon offers a match bonus of 75% of the deposit. The qualifying deposit amount is $100 and the bonus is capped at $1,000 each time. The bonus can be used for wagering on almost any game offered at All Star Slots online casino. Players can choose from Blackjack, Video Poker, Caribbean Games, Table Games, Slots and Keno. Wagering requirements will apply. The deposit and the bonus must be wagered 25 times before a withdrawal is permitted. However some games contribute partially to the wagering requirements. Wagers on Blackjack, Video Pokers and Multi-hand Video Poker count 0.6. For example a $1 wager on Blackjack will only reduce the play through by 60c. Wagers on Roulette, Bingo, Baccarat, Craps, Poker and Sic Bo do not count towards this requirement.</p>
<p>From Friday March 04 to Monday March 07 All Star Slot online casino has revived the popular Mystery Coupons bonus. There are five bonus coupons and each one can be redeemed three times during the promotion period. But players will not know the bonus percent till they have actually redeemed the coupon. To give some hope to the players All Star Slots online casino confirms that one of these mystery codes is worth 100%. These coupons can be used to play Slots, Keno and Scratch Cards. Players who do not like these games or do not like mysteries can avail the 60% Blackjack, Video Poker and Table Games bonus. In both cases wagering requirements apply.</p>
<p>From Tuesday March 8 to Thursday March 10 the Cash Back bonus will be available. The bonus offers 20% cash back on cash losses made during the promotion period. The Cash Back bonus must be wagered 2 times before a withdrawal is permitted. All games are permitted for the Cash Back bonus. The maximum cash out on this bonus is 10 times the bonus amount.</p>
<p>All Star Slots online casino is a brand of the Club World group. It is powered by software from Realtime Gaming and is licensed in Curacao.<br />
