Kingdom Rush 3 Will Be Called &#8216;Kingdom Rush Origins&#8217;

								<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a little tower defense news to round out your week, you&#8217;re in luck. Ironhide Game Studio has released a new teaser trailer for the upcoming third installment of their Kingdom Rush series.</p>
<p>While no gameplay has been shown (it is a teaser trailer, after all), it sets up the premise of the game and finally gives it a name: Kingdom Rush Origins.</p>
<p>Want more details? So do we. Looks like we&#8217;ll have to wait until Ironhide is ready to spill the beans. In the meantime, go and play Kingdom Rush and Kingdom Rush Frontiers if you haven&#8217;t already. In my estimation, these are the finest tower defense games you&#8217;ll get on a touch screen.</p>
