<p><p>Before you can understand the odds in Baccarat  you will need to learn the different rules for the game.&nbsp; Baccarat is a  very strict game with little complication.&nbsp; There are choices in which you  can draw a third card in this two- card card game.&nbsp; There are also only  three, possibly four bets that you can wager.&nbsp; In most casinos you have  the banker, player, and tie bet.&nbsp; On some tables you will even find a  fourth bet on pairs.&nbsp; Usually this is a side bet to make while you make  one of the other three bets.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Baccarat when you look to how you should bet  you need to look at the odds as well as the house edge.&nbsp; The house edge is  as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Banker: 1.04 percent</li>
<li>Player: 1.24 percent</li>
<li>Tie: 14.36 percent</li>
</ul>
<p>These values may change depending on the casino,  as some offer a higher house edge for all three hands.&nbsp; So let's look at  the odds of winning depending on the bet you place.</p>
<p>For the banker hand you have a 50.68 percent  chance of winning the bet.&nbsp; This means you will side on the banker that  their hand is going to have the higher two or three card total topping at  9.&nbsp; The banker is going to charge a commission or tax of five percent to  the winner, but there again you have a higher chance of winning when you bet on  the banker hand.</p>
<p>For the player there is a 49.32 percent chance of  winning.&nbsp; While you can notice this is not a huge difference in odds by  looking at the percentage, you should note that the banker wins three to four  times more on average than any player.</p>
<p>The casino does realize that the player has more  of a chance to win when they bet on the banker.&nbsp; That is why they offer  that commission to reset the odds in favor of you betting on the player.&nbsp;  The fact is you still have over all a loss average of 49.32 percent.</p>
<p>The tie bet is a little different. It is going to  be extremely high odds against you as the player.&nbsp; It also pays out 8 to  1.&nbsp; You have if you place this bet a chance of losing at 84 percent  approximately.&nbsp; So during a strategy session you may decide that you bet  on a tie once out of every hundred games.&nbsp; The point is there are no  patterns to the game play, and betting on the tie is a high risk in which you  will probably never see the payout.</p>
<p>For Baccarat odds you are better off staying with  the banker bet.&nbsp; You have more of a chance to win, and even though you  must pay a commission on the winnings that is small compared to the losses you  could have betting elsewhere.</p>
<p>The pair bet is even worse on odds than the tie  and should not be entered into lightly, even with a payout of 11 to 1.</p></p>
