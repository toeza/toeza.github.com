<p><p>The bonuses at Aladdin's Gold Casino are usually top notch. But this weekend the online casino is outdoing itself. There are two sets of bonuses that will ensure plenty of wagering action at Aladdin's Gold online casino.</p>
<p>The introduction to the first set of bonuses says &quot;Cleopatra's gold is just waiting to be won again&quot;. And this gold is offered in the form of 100 deposit bonuses that are capped at an incredible amount of $100,000. These bonuses have to be availed between January 22 and January 24. 50 coupons are offered for wagering on slots, keno, video slots and scratch cards. Each coupon offers a bonus of 50% of the deposit subject to a maximum of $1,000. 50 coupons are offered for wagering on blackjack and video poker. Each coupon offers a bonus of 40% of the deposit subject to a maximum of $1,000. Wagering requirements will have to be met on all bonuses.</p>
<p>Though the slots bonuses can be wagered on any of the slots games offered at Aladdin's Gold online casino, there seems to be an implicit recommendation to wager on the slot game Cleopatra's Gold. There are several payout opportunities in this game. Cleopatra is the wild symbol and substitutes for other symbols. The highest fixed jackpot pays 10,000 coins in the base game and 30,000 coins in the free spins when five Cleopatra symbols appear in an enabled payline. There is a progressive jackpot that is triggered randomly. The scatter Pyramid symbol offers payouts that are multiplied by the total bet.</p>
<p>The second set of bonuses announced is called Count Your Blessings. These blessings in the form of deposit bonuses are available only on Sunday January 24. Five coupons are being offered and each coupon can be claimed two times. Count Your Blessings is the type of mystery bonus that is offered from time to time at Aladdin's Gold online casino. The mystery lies in the fact that neither the bonus percent nor the maximum limit is known before hand. Players have to claim the bonus and then wait for the surprise. There are wagering requirements for these bonuses as well that can be met on any of the games offered at Aladdin's Gold online casino. However wagers on blackjack, baccarat, craps and video poker games count only half as much.</p>
<p>Aladdin's Gold online casino is a brand of the Club World group. This group has been very much in the news this week. First it won the Best Casino Group 2009 award from Casinomeister. Then it announced the imminent launch of a new brand called Manhattan Slots. The launch will take place at the ICEi expo in London. Club World accepts American players and Manhattan Slots will specifically target the American market. All Club World online casinos are powered by Realtime Gaming and licensed in the gambling jurisdiction of Curacao.<br />
