<p><p>We're a couple of weeks into 2015 now, and lots of new players are just getting over the holiday season enough to get ready to kick off a fresh start and a clean slate with some great deals. WinPalace Casino is a great place to go right now because they are giving new players four different ways to get paid. These deals are pretty impressive, but it's important to pay close attention because they aren't going to last for long. Check out these four offers and you could find yourself getting a lot of depth added to your bankroll today.</p>
<p>The AURORA bonus code is important for slots players because it will give you a flat $400 bonus on deposits of $100 or more. If you aren't wanting to play with quite as much, then the BOREALIS promo code is good for a flat $63 bonus when you deposit $21 and up. Table games fans who deposit a minimum of $100 will earn a flat $250 bonus, and a flat $42 bonus is waiting for table games fans who deposit $21 and above. These deals are set up differently than usual, so make sure that you pay close attention.</p>
<p>These new player promotions are available through January 19, so make sure to get your deposits in before they expire. For the table games deals, you'll need to stick to everything other than roulette, Baccarat, Sic Bo, casino poker, bingo, Pai Gow Poker and craps. The wagering requirements are 30x for all of these codes except that with the table games codes the requirement for video poker and blackjack is 120x. You'll need to stick to slots, keno and scratch cards for the slots bonus offers until the play-through requirements are completed.</p>
<p>WinPalace Casino is giving players four different ways to kick off the year on top of their already incredible welcome bonus package. They give out so many ways to get value that it's hard to keep up with them all, and fresh offers come on a weekly basis. Overall, all you have to do to get a ton of value at this online casino is show up because their deals are so accessible. What's more is that you can use these offers to play just about any of their 120+ games which makes it a perfect set of deals for any type of player.</p></p>
