Make sure there are no gaps between the cards.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 1">[1]</sup>
<ul>

<b class="whb">Gather your guests.</b> Ask your players to sit around the table in a circle. Make sure each person has enough room to move their arms. Additionally, each person should have a full drink.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 2">[2]</sup>
<ul>
<li>You need 3-15 players to play this game. If you play with too many people, it may be hard to keep track of whose turn it is.</li>
<li>You can use any drink you prefer. However, beer is the most popular drink with which to play this game.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Explain the card actions.</b> New players will be unfamiliar with how this game is played. Therefore, you need to briefly explain the actions associated with each card. When each person draws a card, they will need to complete a particular action.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 3">[3]</sup>
<ul>
<li>For example, if someone draws a 3, they have to take a swig of their drink.</li>
<li>If necessary, write the card meanings on a sheet of paper. New players can look at this paper whenever they need help.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Choose someone to draw the first card.</b> Select someone randomly or let the group decide who gets to play first. Next, ask this person to draw a card from the card wreath around the cup.

<ul>
<li>Don't let them peek at the cards before choosing.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Complete the action associated with the card.</b> Examine the card to determine what action the person needs to take. Some cards require the entire group to participate, while others only need one person.

<ul>
<li>For example, if the person draws a 6, all of the men at the table have to take a drink.</li>
<li>If the person draws a 4, all of the women at the table have to take a drink.</li>

<b class="whb">Discard the card.</b> After the necessary actions are completed, discard the card. Do so by placing the card face-up on the table. You can spread them out or place them in a pile. However, make sure discarded cards are kept away from the playing cards to avoid confusion.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 4">[4]</sup>

<b class="whb">Continue taking turns drawing cards.</b> Going clockwise, each person draws a card, completes an action, and discards the card.

<b class="whb">Finish the game when the last king is drawn.</b> Throughout the game, various drinks will be poured into the King's Cup. The game will continue until the very last king card is drawn. The person who draws this card will have to chug all of the liquid in the King's cup, no matter how disgusting it looks.

<ul>
<li>Some people like to chant "Chug! Chug! Chug!" while the unlucky person drinks to motivate them.</li>

<b class="whb">Pick up a six.</b> If you draw a six card of any suit, all of the men at the table have to take a drink. If the person who drew the card is a male, this includes them as well. However, if a lady draws this card, she can choose whether or not she wants to participate.

<b class="whb">Draw an eight.</b> If you draw an eight of any suit, you can choose a drinking partner. This partner must drink with you every time you have to drink. However, you will also drink when your drinking partner has to take a drink. For example:<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 10">[10]</sup>
<ul>

<b class="whb">Pick up a nine.</b> This rule applies to any nine of any suit. Once you draw a nine, you begin the rhyme game. You will begin the game by yelling out any word you choose. Moving clockwise, each person around the table will have to yell out a word that rhymes. The first person to hesitate or choose a non-rhyming word loses and has to take a drink.

<ul>
<li>An example of an easy rhyming word is "hat." There are many, many words that rhyme with hat.</li>
<li>An example of a difficult rhyming word is "area." There are only a few rhyming words.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Choose a ten.</b> If you choose a ten of any suit, you get to begin the Categories game. First, choose a category. This can be anything from liquor types to colors. Next, each player has to name off a word that fits in that category. The first person to repeat a word or hesitate for too long loses. For example:

<ul>
<li>Liquor types would include rum, tequila, vodka, and whisky.</li>
<li>Colors would include simple colors such as blue and red as well as difficult colors such as aquamarine.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Draw a Jack.</b> If you draw a Jack of any suit, you get to invent a new rule. This rule can be anything you'd like. However, try to choose a rule that is fun to do and easy to enforce. For example:

<ul>
<li>Add a "nose goes" rule. Every time you touch your nose, everyone must touch their own noses. The last person to do so must take a drink.</li>
<li>Double the drinking. If you lose a mini-game such as Categories or Thumb Master, you must take two drinks instead of one.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Pick up a Queen.</b> If you draw a Queen, you become the Question Master. Every time you ask someone a question, they must answer with another question. If they don't, they lose and have to take a drink. Your reign as Question Master lasts until another Queen is drawn and a new Question Master is crowned.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 11">[11]</sup> Examples of tricky questions include:

<ul>
<li>"Hey, can you pass me another beer?"</li>
<li>"Whose turn is it?"</li>
<li>"What time is it?"</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Choose a King.</b> If a King is drawn, the person who drew the card must pour a little bit of their drink into the King's Cup. The King's Cup is sitting at the center of the table with the cards spread around it. However, if the fourth King is drawn, that person has to chug the contents of the King's Cup.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 12">[12]</sup>
<ul>
<li>When the King's Cup is drunk, the game is over.</li>
<li>If everyone at the table has different kinds of drinks, the King's Cup will be a gross mix of wine, liquor, and beer. This can make the game more fun!</li>
</ul>
