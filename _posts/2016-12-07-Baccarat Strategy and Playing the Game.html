<p><p>Baccarat is not a complicated game.  In fact the objective is quite simple.  The winning hand is going to be the closest to a total of nine.  What may confuse some individuals at first is that the card game is played against the house rather than the other players at the table.  You also have specific bets that you can place.  The bets are where the game actually has some excitement.  First let's look at how the game is played before we get into the strategy.</p>
<p>There can be three dealers at one table with up to 14 players.  You don't have to be a player at the table to bet.  The dealer is what we call the banker in this game.  They are in charge of the money to payout for the winning wagers.  In Baccarat the banker can also be a player depending on the casino rules you will be playing by. </p>
<p>To start the game you must place an ante wager.  Then two cards are dealt to the player and banker.  You can place three types of bets, one per round of course.  The bets are for the player, for the banker or for a tie.  The hand that reaches close to nine or nine is going to be the winner.  There are some rules as to how you can get a third card, but for the most part in Baccarat the game is played off the original cards.</p>
<p>Now that you understand a little as to how the game is played, let's look at the strategy you can have.  Baccarat has a house edge that is in favor of the banker; therefore it behooves you to bet on the banker rather than the other two bets.  It is also hard to have any type of strategy in this game.  In other words you can't bluff, trade in cards, or find patterns in the game play.  Baccarat is usually played with eight decks.  This means that counting cards is not really possible, and it is considered illegal in casinos. </p>
<p>I say to bet on the banker because the house edge is in favor of the banker winning more times than the player.  In fact studies have shown the banker tends to win three to four times more during the play.  The other side to this is you will lose occasionally when the player wins or there is a tie. </p>
<p>In any casino game there is no guarantee that you will win 100 percent of the time, so it is best in a strategy to play for the team with the better odds, which means the banker.  If the banker has been on a losing streak you can try to bet for the player.  What you don't want to do is increase your bet every time you lose.  Instead stick with the same bet every time.  This helps you to keep your bets under control even when you lose.  Just remember that the house always has the edge against the players, so more often than not bet with them despite the 5 percent commission.<br>
