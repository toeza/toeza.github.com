<b class="whb">Grab a standard 52 deck of cards.</b> Throw out those jokers and shuffle up the cards.

<b class="whb">Grab some space with a flat surface.</b> Although a table is ideal for card games, all you really need is a comfortable space for people to sit around a central location. Cards will be placed in the center for the whole group to share, so be sure to chose a location where everyone will be able to reach and see these communal cards.

<b class="whb">Explain the game goal of racing to collect a hand totaling 31 points.</b> Hands consist of three cards and totals are determined by adding together cards of the same suit.

<img alt="Image titled Play 31 Step 5" width="728" height="546" class="whcdn" id="img_f881c35164" data-src="http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/69/Play-31-Step-5.jpg/aid4368846-728px-Play-31-Step-5.jpg" style="display:none"><noscript><img alt="Image titled Play 31 Step 5" src="http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/69/Play-31-Step-5.jpg/aid4368846-728px-Play-31-Step-5.jpg" width="728" height="546" class="whcdn"></noscript>

<b class="whb">Agree on card values and scoring.</b> Card game rules can vary from group to group as rules are often spread by word of mouth, so be sure your group agrees. Official 31 rules state that an Ace equals 11 points, while Jacks, Queens and Kings count as 10 and number cards are worth their face value.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 2">[2]</sup>
<ul>
<li>Cards can only be added together if they are from the same suit. For example, your hand may consist of a 3 of diamonds, an Ace of spades and a King of spades. The hand??s total would equal 21. The 3 of diamonds is not a spade. It cannot be added together with the King and Ace.</li>
<li>Any hand with three-of-a-kind is worth 30 points. This means a hand of three fives, three deuces or three kings are all worth 30 points and automatically trump any other hand of the same suit worth 30 points.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Receive three ??lives??.</b> Although it is not necessary, some people prefer to play 31 with ??lives??, represented by three chips, three pennies or three of any marker the group chooses. At the end of each round, a loser is determined. That loser must place one of their lives in the middle.

<ul>
<li>After a player looses three lives, they cannot move on to the next round. The game continues until all but one player is eliminated.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Begin play with the player to the left of the dealer.</b> This player has the option to exchange one of their own cards for one of the cards in the window. Players can switch out as many cards as they wish as long as it is their turn.

<b class="whb">Asses your competition's emotions as you play.</b> Try to reach a hand of 31, but also keep an eye on your opponents. Determine if they seem pleased or agitated by gestures, facial expressions and the tones in their voices.

<ul>
<li>Scoring exactly 31 can be a difficult task. Sometimes a player must decide they are as close as they will get. Use your knowledge of the other players to decide if your hand has a good chance of winning. Perhaps you only have a score of 23, but everyone seems disgruntled and the game has been lagging on. You may be the winner.</li>

<b class="whb">Knock when you believe your hand has reached its greatest potential.</b> As soon as you have reached as close to 31 as you believe you can, knock on the table. All other players then have one final turn exchanging cards with the window.

<ul>
<li>If your hand is exactly 31, knock and declare that you have 31. Players do not receive another turn and you show your cards to the group. Everyone else looses and forfeits a life. This can happen at anytime, even after another player has already knocked to begin the final round.</li>
