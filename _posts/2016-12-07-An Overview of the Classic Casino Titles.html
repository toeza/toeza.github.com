<p><p>Because video slots are by far the most popular online casino games available right now, a lot of people don't really know what's available in terms of more traditional casino titles. For example, there's the game of roulette. This game is based on a small ball spinning on a wheel that has the numbers zero through 36 listed. The place where the ball lands determines who wins and who loses. Roulette allows you to customize your bets based on the risk to reward ratio that you want, and that's why it appeals to so many players.</p>
<p>Blackjack is another casino classic. While video slots are all chance, blackjack is on the opposite end of the spectrum since it's considered to be the most strategic and skill-based game widely available. There are a lot of different blackjack variations, so you always have something new to try, but there's a lot of thinking and planning that goes on in this game. If you're getting bored with video slots and how straight-forward they are, then you might want to try out some basic blackjack games. With a small amount of strategic knowledge, you can have a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Although it looks a lot like blackjack, Baccarat is really its own beast. While this game uses cards, it's actually completely based on chance. The house advantage in this game is fairly small if you always avoid the tie bet which is a terrible bet with a huge house advantage in the 13-14 percent range. This game doesn't have a ton of action, but it's an awesome social game that can be a lot of fun to play with live dealers or in a multi-player environment since you get to meet people and enjoy the overall experience.</p>
<p>Craps is another classic casino title that doesn't get much attention. One of the reasons it gets ignored a lot is that it has an appearance of being extremely complicated. In all reality, it's about as straight-forward as roulette. You're basically deciding if you want to bet with or against the shooter, and the shooter is the person rolling the dice. There are certain rules that determine when the shooter wins or loses, and you basically get to bet with or against that. It's a fun action game that has kept people hooked for decades, and it has a lot more depth than most slots.</p></p>
