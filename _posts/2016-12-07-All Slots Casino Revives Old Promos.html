<p><p>Slots All Star Competition and Head of the Table Playoff were two promotions that were extremely popular at All Slots online casino in 2009. By popular demand All Slots has revived those promotions this month.</p>
<p>Slots All Star Competition is being held first. The promotion starts on January 19 and will run till January 25. In order to participate in the promotion players must purchase and wager at least 50 credits during the promotion period on any slot game offered at All Slots online casino. Wagering on the live slot tournaments will not count. Players will earn leader board points as follows. They will earn 1 point for 50 credits wagered during the promotion period; 1 point for 50 credits won per day and 1 point for 50 credits lost per day. The leader board will be updated every 30 minutes to reflect points earned through wagering. Points earned through wins and losses will be entered on the leader board once a day. At the end of the promotion period, the top players on the leader board will share the prize pool of 10,000 credits. The player in the first place will receive 1,000 credits. The prizes will be treated as bonuses. Normal players at All Slots online casino will be required to play through their prizes 30 times before making a withdrawal. VIP players have wagering requirements of only 15 times. All Slots is a Microgaming online casino and follows the ClearPlay Bonus System. If wagering requirements are not met within 30 days of being awarded the prizes will be deemed to have expired.</p>
<p>The Head of the Table Playoff will start on January 26 after the Slots All Star Competition is over. It will run up to February 1. This promotion has an identical structure as the previous one. The only difference is the choice of games. The Head of the Table Playoff will be played on all video poker and table games on offer at All Slots online casino. These include variants of video poker, power poker, table poker, red dog, casino war, and blackjack. Wagering on live blackjack tournaments, baccarat, craps, roulette and sic bo are will not count towards the promotion.</p>

These promotions are offered at all group online casinos but each player can participate from only one of them. All Slots online casino is powered by software from Microgaming.
