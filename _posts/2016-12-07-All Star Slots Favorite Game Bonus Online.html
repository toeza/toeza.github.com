<p><p>Online casinos usually offer different bonus terms for different games. Online games like slots that have higher house edges usually have larger bonuses on them. However, for a short period of time All Star Slots online casino is offering a bonus that can be used by the player on his favorite game. </p>
<p>The Favorite Games bonus is available at All Star Slots online casino from Tuesday March 20 to Thursday March 22. Players who are willing to deposit a minimum of $50 can take advantage of this offer. The bonus coupon provides a bonus that is 75% of the deposit subject to a maximum of $1,000. The coupon can be redeemed three times in the promotion period, which means a player can get up to $3,000 in bonuses within a space of three days. Though the bonus percent and upper limit is the same for all casino games, All Star Slots online casino has differentiated in the wagering requirements. In general the deposit and bonus must be wagered 25 times before a withdrawal is permitted. However, wagers on blackjack and video poker games will count only 60% towards meeting wagering requirements. </p>
<p>During the weekend from Friday March 23 to Monday March 26 All Star Slots online casino offers a bonus that is different in some ways. Players will be required to make an increased deposit of $100. Against this they will get a flat bonus of $100. This is good for the low rollers because they get a 100% bonus on their deposit, but not so good for the high rollers because the bonus is capped at $100. This bonus coupon can also be redeemed thrice during the promotion period. The wagering requirements are a flat $5,000, which works out to 25 times the deposit and bonus as before. The advantage with this bonus offer is that the contribution from blackjack and video poker games is not discounted. However, wagers on roulette, bingo, baccarat, craps, poker and Sic Bo do not count towards this requirement. This is because in these games players can abuse the wagering requirements by hedging even money bets. </p>
<p>From Tuesday March 27 to Thursday March 29 All Star Slots online casino offers its standard bonuses, but with a twist. For slots, keno and scratch cards unlimited coupons are available of 65% bonuses with a $1,000 cap. For blackjack, video poker and other games unlimited coupons are available of 55% bonuses with a $1,000 cap. If a player claims five bonuses of the same type within the promotion period then he will be entitled to a $25 free chip. All Star Slots online casino is a brand of the Club World group. It is powered by software from Realtime Gaming and is licensed in Curacao.<br />
