<p><p>A new month has come, and we're officially moving towards the end of the year. With just five months left in the calendar year, online casinos are working hard to give players something special to work with so that they can try to end the year on a strong note. WinPalace Casino is giving players several different opportunities to get a piece of some bonus action this week with several different bonus codes available for different games.</p>
<p>Kick things off with a special 195 percent slots offer on any deposit that uses the PALMIER1 bonus code. You can ramp it up to 215 percent just by making your deposit at least $50 with the PALMIER2 bonus code, or you can get 255 percent by depositing $100 and up with PALMIER3. The PALMIER4 code is good for 300 percent when you deposit $200 and up, and a deposit of $500 or more will get you 357 percent when you use the PARIS5 code. Pay attention because the codes don't all use the same name! The PARIS6 high roller code gets you 408 percent on any deposit of $1,000 or more this week with this special offer.</p>
<p>If you like table games, WinPalace Casino has you taken care of this week. The 2PAIRS1 bonus code will get you 126 percent when you make any deposit of $21 or more. If you want to get 145 percent, just deposit $50 or more with the 2PAIRS2 code, and if you want a nice 174 percent, make it $100 and up with the 2PAIRS3 bonus code. The 2PAIRS4 bonus code gives you 235 percent when you deposit at least $250, and you can use the 2PAIRS5 code when you deposit $500 or more to get a nice 312 percent match.</p>
<p>On the PALMIER and PARIS codes, you'll need to clear the 30x wagering requirement on slots, scratch card games or keno. These are the only games allowed with these offers, and you'll have to clear the requirement before you can cash out. On the table games bonuses, you'll have to avoid playing casino poker, bingo, sic bo, pai gow poker, Baccarat, craps and roulette. You'll need to meet the 30x wagering requirement on any games besides those, but your bets on video poker and blackjack will only count as 25 percent as their face values while you're trying to clear the play-through requirements.</p></p>
