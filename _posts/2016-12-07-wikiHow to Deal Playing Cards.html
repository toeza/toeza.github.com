<b class="whb">Know the basics.</b>

<ul>
<li>Read the game rules, to see if each player gets an even amount of cards or a different amount.</li>
<li>Check to see if the game requires a separate pile on the side. This extra pile is known as a "kitty" or "discard pile". It can be used as extra cards to play in the game, a discard pile for unwanted cards, or leftover ones that aren't going to be used in the game.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Count how many people are playing the game.</b> The smaller amount of people that play, the more cards a person gets, as well as the higher amount of people, the less cards a person gets. Assuming that the entire deck without Jokers are dealt, this is a general guide:

<ul>
<li>2 people = 26 cards each with 0 leftovers</li>
<li>3 people = 17 cards each with 1 leftover</li>
<li>4 people = 13 cards each with 0 leftovers</li>
<li>5 people = 10 cards each with 2 leftovers</li>
<li>6 people = 8 cards each with 4 leftovers</li>
<li>7 people = 7 cards each with 3 leftovers</li>
<li>8 people = 6 cards each with 4 leftovers</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Shuffle the cards thoroughly.</b> Make sure that the cards are facing down to ensure that no one can see what other people are getting.

<b class="whb">Start out with the person on your left when dealing the cards.</b> Move clock-wise in a circle and give yourself a card last. Repeat the process until the amount of cards specified in the rules are distributed.

<b class="whb">Double check the amount of cards distributed.</b> Once the discard pile is made, do a card count. Everyone should have the same amount of cards, except if the card rules says differently.

<b class="whb">Know that for the next game, the person to the left of the previous dealer is the new dealer.</b> The previous dealer then gets the 2nd to the last card of the "round".
