<p><p>Bodog is an online gambling portal that was founded in 1994 by Calvin Ayre. It offers gambling products like poker, casino, sports betting and horse racing. <strong>Bodog Casino</strong> is powered by Real Time Gaming. Its North American site is licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission. </p>
<p>From the 12th of February to the 12th of March Bodog Casino is holding a Baccarat online tournament. Baccarat is a game made popular by James Bond. The secret agent played in the swankiest of casinos always dressed to immaculate perfection. However to play baccarat at Bodog Casino one need not dress to kill. The promo header says, &quot;In fact, you don't have to dress at all&quot;. Players have to be valid members of Bodog Casino in order to participate. </p>
<p>The rules are very simple. Players have to play as many hands of baccarat as possible. For each hand that ends in a tie players will be awarded 1 Point. To get more points players have to get more tied hands. To get more tied hands players have to play more hands. The player with the most Points will win. A tied hand is one in which the player and the banker have hands of identical value. Cards from Ace to Nine have their face values. Tens, Jacks, Queens and Kings have zero value. A hand is valued by adding the card values and then dropping the tens digit from the sum. The highest possible hand value is 9 and the lowest possible hand value is 0. </p>
<p>The tournament runs through four weeks. On the Friday of each week prizes of a $100 casino chip each will be awarded to the top five players in the leader board. The number of Points won in the preceding week will decide the leader board standings. There will also be a Grand Prize of a $1,000 casino chip. This will be awarded to the player with the highest number of points in the entire promotion period. The Grand Prize will not be subject to any rollover requirements. In all prizes worth $3,000 are being awarded in this baccarat tournament. </p>
<p>The baccarat leader board is titled ??Who's the King of Swank??? There are already ten names in this week's leader board. James of Branson heads the list with 244 Points. Hence there is plenty of catching up to do, but it is not too late. Baccarat hands play very fast and ties are not as infrequent as one may think. Those who are not members of Bodog Casino will have to join first. The procedure is extremely simple and takes no time at all. And new players are entitled to a 10% sign up bonus as well.</p>
