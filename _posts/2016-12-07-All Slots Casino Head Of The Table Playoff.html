<p><p>Last week All Slots online casino had hosted the Slots All Star Competition. This week a new short duration promotion has been announced. The promotion is called Head of the Table Playoff. It is similar in structure to the Slots All Star Competition, only the games are different. Whereas last week's promotional event was based on online slots, this week's promotion is based on a variety of card games. The write up for the promotion states &quot;Play your cards right and win the $1,000 top prize.&quot; </p>
<p>The Head of the Table Playoff promotion has commenced at All Slots online casino on Tuesday August 25 and will run till Monday August 31. Since all points accumulated over the promotion period count for the final tally players should join immediately, because there is not much time left to make up. In order to be in the reckoning for the prizes players have to purchase and wager at least 50 credits during the promotion period on any of the eligible games. The eligible games include all forms of video poker including Microgaming's multi hand video poker games known as the Power Poker series. All forms of table poker games and blackjack games offered at All Slots online casino are also included. Red dog and casino war can also be played in the Head of the Table Playoff promotion. However live blackjack tournaments, baccarat, craps, roulette and sic bo are excluded.</p>
<p>The Head of the Table Playoff promotion is a leader board event and the players who accumulate the most points will share the guaranteed prize pool. There are three ways that players can earn points in this promotion. They will earn 1 point per 50 credits wagered over the promotion period. They will earn 1 point per 50 credits won per day and 1 point per 50 credits lost per day. Wins and losses are the positive or negative difference between the amount wagered and amount paid out. Since the players will be wagering with their own funds they would obviously prefer to earn points by winning, but even if they lose they are compensated to some extent. Obviously whatever the players win is theirs to keep. </p>
<p>The prize pool consists of 10,000 credits. Players will get paid in the currency of their wagering. All Slots online casino supports wagering in U.S. Dollars, British Pounds and Euros. The first place prize is 1,000 credits. This goes down to 75 credits for the fifth place. The sixth to tenth place players get 50 credits each. In all 100 players will win prizes. </p>
<p>All Slots online casino is powered by Microgaming and is licensed by both the Lotteries and Gaming Authority of Malta and the Kahnawake Gaming Commission. It has been approved as &quot;Safe and Fair&quot; by eCOGRA. All Slots is a leading brand of the Jackpot Factory group.<br />
