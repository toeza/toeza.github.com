Marvel Contest of Champions Release Date Revealed in New Trailer

								<p>Greetings, true believers! Are you ready for some super good news? Kabam&#8217;s upcoming comic book brawler has a new trailer, and that trailer has a big reveal. While the <em>exact</em> day hasn&#8217;t been pinned down yet, you can expect Marvel Contest of Champions release date to happen this December.</p>
<p>The game has recently soft-launched in Denmark, and those who&#8217;ve played it are quickly drawing comparisons to the mobile version of Injustice: Gods Among Us (aka, the portable DC punch&#8217;em&#8217;up). It&#8217;s not a clone?by any stretch, but it sounds like they&#8217;re cut from a similar cloth.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at the New York Comic-Con this weekend, be sure to check it out at the Marvel booth (#1354).</p>
