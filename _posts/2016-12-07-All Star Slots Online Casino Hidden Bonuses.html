<p><p>From Tuesday July 17 to Thursday July 19 All Star Slots online casino is offering higher bonus percentages. The catch is that the percentages are hidden. There are four mystery coupons on offer during the promotion period. All Star Slots online casino says, ??These coupons are all worth over 70% but one of these mystery codes is worth 95%.?? This is great because the standard reload bonuses for online slots offer only 65% of the deposit. Another attraction of this promotional offer is that each bonus coupon can be redeemed up to four times. Wagering requirements have been specified for the hidden bonuses. The deposit and the bonus must be wagered 25 times before a cash out is permitted. The only possible drawback of the hidden bonuses is that they must be wagered only on slots, keno and scratch cards for meeting the wagering requirements.
