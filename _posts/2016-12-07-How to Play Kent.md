<b class="whb">To win a round, one member of a team must acquire four cards of the same rank.</b> The other member of that team then has to recognize that their partner has collected four of a kind by saying "Kent!" (or "Kemps!" or "Pickle!", depending on the version of the game).

<b class="whb">Before beginning the game, work out a signal with your partner.</b> This could be something as simple as blinking several times in a row, or you could use something more complex, like clearing your throat and crossing your arms a certain way. Now sit across from your partner so that you can easily make eye contact with them.

<b class="whb">Deal out four starting cards to each player.</b> Place the rest of the cards in the middle of the table so that all the players have access to them.

<b class="whb">The first person to go draws a card from the pile.</b> If they have a matching card in their hand, they discard one of their <i>other</i> cards to be replaced by the new card. If they don't, they will typically set the new card back down.

<b class="whb">Play proceeds around the table until someone yells "Kent!</b>". If that team has 4 cards of the same rank, they win the round and receive the letter K.

<ul>
<li>If you think that another team is about to call Kent, call out "Cut!" or "Counter-Kent!". This will result in you winning the round instead.</li>
<li>If you think you and your partner <i>both</i> have four cards of the same rank, you can say "Double-Kent!" and get twice as many letters, for example, a K and an E in the same round. (You should probably have a different signal for Double-Kent than for regular Kent, so make sure you and your partner are on the same page at all times.)</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">The first group to spell out K-E-N-T is the winning team.</b> In some variations the team has to spell out a longer word or take extra measures to win a round, but this is the simplest version of Kent, so just follow the steps here and you should be fine. Good luck!
