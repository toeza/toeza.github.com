								<p>Not that long ago?we caught wind of a brand new, mobile-exclusive entry in the Need for Speed franchise. Only we didn&#8217;t hear it from EA, but rather, racer extrordinaire Ken Block. The car he revealed for his Gymkhana Seven video (you can watch it here) sported a Need for Speed: No Limits logo, which instantly set our minds alight with questions.</p>

<p>Today, one?of those questions has been answered. EA Mobile has confirmed that the game is being developed by Firemonkeys, who previously brought us the sublime mobile version of Need for Speed: Most Wanted (as well as the Real Racing series).</p>
<p>Beyond that bit of information, you&#8217;ll have to gleam whatever guesswork you can out of the teaser video that was released today.?One thing seems certain from the trailer: there&#8217;ll be street racing aplenty.</p>
<p>Expect Need for Speed: No Limits to hit mobile devices in 2015.</p>
