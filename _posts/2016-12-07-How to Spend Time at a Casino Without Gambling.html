<b class="whb">Look at a map of the casino and even surrounding areas, including neighboring properties.</b> You will need to find your way around buildings kept deliberately dark or without windows or you can easily lose your bearings. If you leave a casino, make sure you know which entrance to return to and which side or street you will face.

<b class="whb"><b>Find the high-roller tables.</b></b> If they are not behind guarded doors in private areas, go stand around the real gambling tables. There are people who play seriously for high stakes. This is where the real drama of a casino lies.

<b class="whb">Take the kids on an adventure.</b> Children are not allowed in the gaming halls themselves, but depending on their ages, there are many distractions for them elsewhere. Let them find the animals, various places (such as the buffet), or follow a floor plan map as a maze. Take them to an appropriate show, the water park, the swimming pool, or the musical fountain. Find child care through the hotel for babies.

<b class="whb">Check out security.</b> Discretely spend some time watching the security systems. Sit in one place in the casino hall and notice the ceiling camera systems, the staff around the tables, the pit bosses moving around. Notice how dealers handle money and how customers are managed.

<b class="whb"><b>Pamper yourself.</b></b> Maybe this is the break you finally get to find a manicure, pedicure, or a day spa. Get a haircut, a massage (check the hotel concierge for referrals), or find a hot tub. Go swimming at the hotel pool, read a book at the shore, or try the hotel health center.

<b class="whb">Tour the neighborhood.</b> You might be in Las Vegas with a whole strip to explore. You could be in Reno, Virginia City, Atlantic City with a beach, on a river boat with shores passing by, a tribal gaming area close to forests and lakes, even in Macao with a historic city around you. Go out and enjoy the scenery or take a hotel bus tour to the nearby tourist areas (Hoover Dam, the ski slopes, around town). Go for a hike, a ski tour, or a bike ride.
