<p>Wine glasses are beautiful, and often very delicate. If your wine glasses are made out of crystal, they cannot be washed in the dishwasher like ordinary glasses, and will require extra special care. This article will show you a few different ways of cleaning wine glasses, as well as how to remove stubborn stains.</p>

<b class="whb">Hold the glass carefully by the bowl and not by the stem.</b> The stem is fragile, and the glass can break easily if you hold it by that. Instead, cup your hand around the bottom of the bowl, with your fingers to either side of the steam.

<ul>
<li>This method will also work for regular wine glasses.</li>
<li>If you are cleaning painted or glittered wine glasses, use this method.</li>
</ul>

<b class="whb">Rinse the glasses in lukewarm to hot water.</b> If the water is too hot for you, it is likely too hot for the wine glass; water can cause glass to crack if it is hot enough. Sometimes, this is all that is needed to clean the glass.

3

<b class="whb">Wipe the glass clean with a long-handled sponge.</b> Avoid sticking your hand into the glass itself, or you will risk breaking the glass. Instead, find a soft sponge attached to a long, plastic handle. Focus your cleaning on the places that get the most dirty, such as the rim, the bottom of the glass, and the outside of the bowl.

<ul>
<li>Do not use steal wool or a scouring pad.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 1">[1]</sup> Also, avoid using anything with stiff, plastic bristles. All of these can scratch the surface.</li>
</ul>

4

<b class="whb">Use a mild, odorless dish soap if needed.</b> Usually, a simple rinse and light buffing with a soft sponge is all that is needed. If the wine glass is especially dirty, however, you might need to use a mild dish soap. You will not need a lot; a small drop will be enough.

<ul>
<li>Try to use a low-alkaline detergent, if possible.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 2">[2]</sup>

5

<b class="whb">Rinse each glass well, inside and out, with hot water.</b> Be sure to get rid of any soap residue. Crystal absorbs odors and flavors easily. If you don't rinse the wine glass well enough, your next glass of wine might have a slight soapy flavor.

<b class="whb">Place the wine glass upside down on a soft towel so that it can air dry.</b> The soft cloth will help protect the rim from the hard surface of your counter or table.

7

<b class="whb">Dry the glasses with a soft, lint-free towel if you live in an area that has hard water.</b> This will help prevent any hard water stains. Use a soft, lint-free cloth, such as microfiber.



</li>
<li class="hasimage hasad">

<img alt="Image titled Clean Wine Glasses Step 8" width="728" height="546" class="whcdn" id="img_c0df2ef9b9" data-src="http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/32/Clean-Wine-Glasses-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid1822297-728px-Clean-Wine-Glasses-Step-8-Version-2.jpg" style="display:none"><noscript><img alt="Image titled Clean Wine Glasses Step 8" src="http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/32/Clean-Wine-Glasses-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid1822297-728px-Clean-Wine-Glasses-Step-8-Version-2.jpg" width="728" height="546" class="whcdn"></noscript>

8

<b class="whb">Know that some stains may be permanent.</b> Crystal is a very porous material. It absorbs flavors and is easily damaged. If the crystal wine glasses have turned foggy because they were cleaned in the dishwasher at some point in time, the damage is permanent. The heat of the dishwasher would have baked the detergent into the glass.

1

<b class="whb">Choose short-stemmed wine glasses made out of glass.</b> Do not use this method for crystal wine glasses, or for wine glasses with long, delicate stems. Also, do not use this method for painted or glittered wine glasses.



</li>
<li class="hasimage">

2

<b class="whb">Plan on washing the glasses separate from the rest of your dishes.</b> Do not load them in with anything that is very dirty or greasy. The grease can get on the glasses and smear them.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 3">[3]</sup>

3

<b class="whb">Place the glasses upside down on the top rack, and space them so that they are not touching.</b> Try to have about a hands width between each glass. This will lessen the chances of the glasses bumping against each other and chipping.



</li>
<li class="hasimage">

4

<b class="whb">Use a small amount of odorless detergent.</b> The less detergent you use, the better. Also, try to use a mild, low-alkaline detergent. Do not add any rinse-aid. Rinse-aid may help prevent water stains, but it will also leave behind a chemical residue that will affect the flavor of your next glass of wine.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 4">[4]</sup>
<ul>
<li>If the wine glasses are stained, consider adding half a wine glass of white vinegar into the wash cycle.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 5">[5]</sup>

5

<b class="whb">Use a short, gentle cycle.</b> If you can, try to use a lower water temperature setting as well. The higher the water temperature, the more likely your wine glasses will be to crack.

6

<b class="whb">Skip the drying cycle.</b> Instead, open the door at the end of the cycle to let the glasses air dry without humidity.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 6">[6]</sup>

<b class="whb">Dry the glasses by hand if you live in an area with hard water.</b> Gently wipe them dry with a soft, lint-free cloth (such as microfiber), and put them away.

<b class="whb">Bring a pot of water to a boil over the stove.</b> Fill a pot with water and place it on the stove. Turn the stove on to high and wait for the water to begin boiling.

1

<b class="whb">Line the bottom of plastic container with a soft cloth.</b> The container should be large enough to fit your wine glass. The soft cloth is important, as it will help protect the wine glass from getting scratched.

<ul>
<li>This method is great for glasses that have turned foggy. It is also good for tough wine stains.</li>

<b class="whb">Add five tablespoons of white vinegar.</b> The vinegar will dissolve any wine or mineral residue. If you can't find any vinegar, you can use some baking soda or washing soda instead.
