								<p>Mobile games advertising on primetime television still isn&#8217;t as common as I&#8217;d have expected by late 2014, but I still can&#8217;t help but smile whenever I see a Clash of Clans ad pop up in-between instructions it by Eggo Waffles and Ford Fiestas.</p>
<p>King is jumping into the game too, with a new ad for Diamond Digger Saga that seems to put a Claymation-inspired spin on things.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time we&#8217;ve seen a TV spot from King &#8211; they had some neat ones in Asian markets for Candy Crush Saga and Farm Heroes Saga a while back &#8211; but it&#8217;s certainly the first we&#8217;ve seen for Diamond Digger Saga.</p>
<p>The game has held a spot in the App Store&#8217;s Top 100 since debuting in early September, and with new devices and Christmas shopping just around the corner, a TV campaign might help them maintain (and, as I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re hoping, grow) that success.</p>
